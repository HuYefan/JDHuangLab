## Synthetic Biology

### Pattern Formation
Synthetic Biology refers to the design and fabrication of biological components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world; and the re-design and fabrication of existing biological systems for useful purpose. The Huang Lab laboratory is aiming to design and fabricate artificial biological parts, devices and circuits to control pattern formation, stem cell self-renewal/differentiation, and to attack tumors.

Bacterial cells are programmed to form sequential patterns with tunable number of rings.

### Vaccine Design
#### Antigenic Field Theory and Vaccines against Viruses
Current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against symptomatic disease, but repeated booster doses using vaccines based on the ancestral strain offer limited additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). To address this, we used "antigenic distance" to *in silico* select optimized booster vaccine seed strains effective against both current and future VOCs. Based on research and analysis of immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the researchers constructed an "antigen distance" model using existing neutralization and sequencing data. This model measured the degree of immune escape between different mutant strains based on the neutralizing abilities of human sera against various strains. Based on the "antigenic distance", the researchers can generate a region in which each point (variant) has a vaccine efficacy associated with it. In the Discussion of the paper, the researchers proposed a new concept called the "antigen field" to better understand and quantify the interactions (immune responses) between the human immune system and foreign antigens. This concept is similar to an "electric field" and refers to the fundamental interactions diffused within the immune space. Infection or administration of a specific antigen generates an "antigen field." After its activation, this antigen field can "repel" subsequent antigens attempting to enter the same field or antigens that are in close proximity to the initial antigen in terms of antigenic distance. The proposed "antigenic field" concept opens new avenues for understanding the immune system's interaction with foreign antigens, potentially influencing future vaccine and immunotherapy development.

#### Vaccines for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) 
Effective vaccines can prevent infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria by inducing protective immunity before the bacteria proliferation and spread. However, live attenuated vaccines may have the risk of virulence and immune escape, and recombination vaccines can hardly offer effective protection. In this way, it is critical to engineer bacteria by weakening their virulence but keeping the protective immunity. We rationally deigned vaccines against *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.

#### Bacteria-based Cancer Vaccines
*Salmonella* is a Gram-negative species that generally causes self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans.  We rationally designed and engineered *Salmonella* that can selectively colonize tumors, where they can proliferate and exert direct oncolytic effects as well as stimulating the immune system.

## Intracellular Transportation

Our major research interest is in the mechanism of intracellular transportation and its roles in development, neuronal function and genetic diseases. Within the cell, a variety of cellular components are moved to specific sites at specific times. The intracellular transportation processes are essential not only for housekeeping purpose but also for specialized cellular functions, such as the transport of synaptic vesicles. Intracellular transportation is carried out over two major cellular networks, the microtubule and actin networks. Microtubule motors include the kinesin and dynein families of proteins while actin motors are the myosin family of proteins. Current research suggests that the microtubule network is used for transport over long distances while the actin network is used for short-range delivery in animal cells. Disruption of these processes result in genetic diseases. For example, mutation in myosin-VA results in human Griscelli disease characterized by pigment dilution, immunodeficiency, neurological defect and cognitive disorder. Mutations in other motor molecules result in many other diseases such as heart diseases and deafness.

My previous work demonstrated that myosin-VA can interact directly with the ubiquitously expressed kinesin, implying that the two transportation systems are at least partially coordinated through their motor molecules. The major interest of my group is to use transgenic and knockout mice to study the functions of kinesins in chondrocytes, neurons, and other cell types.
