## A HAPPY DAY FOR HUANG LAB

The first good news is that a manuscript on pattern formation from Huang lab with Dr. Chenli Liu and Mr. Xiongfei Fu as first authors has been accepted by Science.

The second good news is that Mr. Raozhou Lin married his beautiful bride, Ivy, in a very touching wedding in Hong Kong. Many lab members attend the wedding to hear them say “I do.”

We wish the couple a beautiful life ahead.
