Biological structures are often repeated in different numbers in an organism.  For example, human have five similar fingers on each hand, (horse has one and cow has two).  Another example is that human have 33 vertebras while a snake can have three hundred. While nature has done generated these repetitive structures many times, the principal behind is largely a mystery. It is very challenging to generate the repeated structures and control the numbers by genetic engineering.

Now, our lab together with our friends in Hong Kong,  the USA and Germany has studied the underlying principle and engineered cells to form repeated stripes. The engineered cells are first seeded (far left). The cells are then proliferate and move. Due to the engineering design, the cells can move readily when cell-density is low. As cells proliferate, high cell density regions build up. Cells (shown in teal) in these regions stop moving according to our design. Some cells (shown in khaki) in the adjacent low-density regions can move towards and join the high-density regions, and stop moving while some other cells can move forward to form more high-density regions and repeat this cycle. These processes are repeated many times to form repeated stripes/rings
