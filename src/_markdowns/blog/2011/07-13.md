---

Today, Mr. Chenli Liu passed his oral defense.

Congratulations, Dr. Liu!

The external examiner, a world-leading synthetic biologist, commented on Dr. Liu’s thesis:

“This is a world-class body of work and is competitive with the best theses that I have seen at UCSF, Caltech, and MIT. I would be very proud if one of my students put this together.”
